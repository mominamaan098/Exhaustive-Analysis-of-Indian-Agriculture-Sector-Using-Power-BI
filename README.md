# Exhaustive-Analysis-of-Indian-Agriculture-Sector-Using-Power-BI
Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for Indian agriculture, covering 615M tons of crop production data across 19 years, 32 states, and 623 districts. The analysis identifies top crops (wheat, potato, gram), leading states (Uttar Pradesh, Punjab), and seasonal production trends. Interactive visualizations track yearly production variations, high and low-performing districts, and efficiency trends. This project provides valuable insights for agricultural planning, resource allocation, and productivity enhancement.
